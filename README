Album (code name Aberration)

Copyright (c) 2006-2009 by Matja탑 Kova훾

Album is a file browsing and tagging utility for BeOS and compatibles. It started out with a goal of the ultimate image organiser (code named Aberration), 
but ended up as something much more modest and BeOS-specific. 
The idea is to have a work pad for pictures from different locations where they can be previewed and tagged in one place. 
The program is not limited to picture files and BFS (Be File System) volumes, although that further limits whatever the usefulness since 
much of the functionality has to do with file attributes. 

COMPATIBILITY

This program is designed for the BeOS R5. 
As of time of this release it works with the latest Haiku OS development builds.

CHANGES

From 0.9.1 to 0.9.2
- Improved inter-apllication interoperability by implementing the negotiaded drag&drop. This allows you to drag images from PhotoGrabber (camera import utility) and similar applications. It isn't ideal though. 
The problem is that kind of data exchange only works on files so Album first
creates a temporary directory in B_COMMON_TEMP_DIRECTORY/Album and starts watching for new files. 
It then instructs the sender (the application files are dragged from) to store its
stuff there. If the sender somehow manages to overwrite existing files, they won't show up, because nothing was created, technically.
Remember to move images to a safer location by dragging them from Album elsewhere.

- Responds to Open With.. in Tracker.
